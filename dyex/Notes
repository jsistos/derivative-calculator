        - Double underscore in functions makes them private (?). Need more research into that.
        - How does python decide which folder is the main folder? Why do I get an error when running
          tests? 
            File "test_parser.py", line 1, in <module>
                from ..dyex.tools.parser import Parser
                ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
        - Boi what? What is the difference between a script and a module?
